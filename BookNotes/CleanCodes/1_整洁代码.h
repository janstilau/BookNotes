 1.C++发明者
 我喜欢优雅和高效的代码,代码逻辑应该直截了当,叫缺陷难以隐藏,尽量减少依赖关系,便于维护;依据某种分层战略,完善错误处理代码.
 性能调至最有,省得引诱别人做没有规矩的优化,搞出一堆混乱来.整洁的代码只做好一件事.(糟糕的代码,想做要的事太多,它们意图混乱,目的含混)
 整洁的代码力求集中,每个函数,每个类,每个模块都全神贯注于一件事,不受四周细节的干扰和污染.
 整洁的代码,简单直接,不隐藏设计者的意图,充满了干净利落的抽象和直接了当的控制语句.
 2.破窗理论
 窗户破损的建筑,让人感觉是无人照顾,于是别人也就在不关心,放任窗户继续破损,最终自己也参加破坏活动,在外墙上涂鸦,任垃圾堆积.
 一扇破损的窗户,导致了大厦走向了破坏的道路.
 3.Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal depen- dencies, which are explicitly defined, and pro- vides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone.
 4. I could list all of the qualities that I notice in clean code, but there is one overarching quality that leads to all of them. Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious that you can do to make it better. All of those things were thought about by the code’s author, and if you try to imagine improvements, you’re led back to where you are, sitting in appreciation of the code someone left for you—code left by some- one who cares deeply about the craft.
 5. Runs all the tests;
 • Contains no duplication;
 • Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system;
 • Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.
 6. You know you are working on clean code when each routine you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected. You can call it beautiful code when the code also makes it look like the language was made for the problem.
